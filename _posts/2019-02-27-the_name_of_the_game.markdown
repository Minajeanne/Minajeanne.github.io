  Starting over professionally is terrifying, especially if you factor in 10+ years of effort in one direction and a big, fat, cushy comfort zone. So why do it? There are probably as many answers to that as there are people who have taken that leap of faith, but I think most of those people would agree that it boils down to fear. Fear of stagnating in a current role. Fear of missing out on new possibilities. Fear of wondering ‘what if?’ for the rest of your life. I know that’s what led me to leave behind a good job and most of my self confidence. Now I joyfully ride the emotional roller coaster that is learning to code. During the lows (cue Collaborating Objects lab), I remind myself that I will only be a newb for so long; I will eventually stop making the same mistakes over and over. I love what I’m learning and the highs push me forward. Each green check mark represents progress, and that’s the name of the game.
